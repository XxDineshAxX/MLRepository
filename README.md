This is my portfolio for my Machine Learning assignments.

## Technical Skills

Throughout this portfolio, many technical skills were practiced and improved upon to help produce the best results. A list of some of the technical skills and soft skills exercised are: critical/analytical thinking, leadership, communication, scheduling, flexibility, problem-solving, teamwork/cooperation, Data Analysis, Python, R, Markdown, and C++. You can find my resume [here](Resume_DineshAngadipeta.pdf) that goes more into detail on these skills.  

## Overview of ML

This assignment here covers my general understanding of machine learning at the beginning of the course.
You can see my write up on this topic [here](OverviewofML.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration 

This assignment here covers how the R programming language has built in data exploration tools whereas other programming languages require you to code said data exploration tools manually. This assignment also goes over the uses of covariance and correlation. You can see my write up on this topic [here](CSMLComponent1.pdf) and the code for this assignment [here.](CSMLComp1.cpp)

## Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models

This assignment covers how to use Linear and Logistic Regression in R. I worked on this Portfolio Component with Alejo Vinluan(ABV210001). We implemented the use of various R functions to explore massive datasets and find pattersn for predictions and to see if the patterns were strong. You can see the Regression Notebook PDF [here](Regression.pdf) and the CLassification Notebook PDF [here](Classification.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 3: ML Algorithms from Scratch 

This assignment covers how much more efficient the Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes functions were in R compared to C++. I worked on this Portfolio Component with Alejo Vinluan(ABV210001). We implemented the Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes functions into C++ and could visibly see how much harder it is to code pre-existing R functions. You can see the Document PDF [here](MLAlgosFromScratch.pdf), the Logistic Regression C++ code [here](MLAlgosFromScratch.cpp), the Naïve Bayes C++ code [here](naive_bayes.cpp), and the dataset used [here](titanic_project.csv).

## Portfolio Component 4: Searching for Similarity

This assignment deals with similarity algorithms such as using kNN and decision trees along with other common regression methods to find patterns and relationships. Listed here are the components of this portfolio component and the respective links. [Narrative Document](CS_4375_Ensemble_Assignment.pdf), [Notebook 1 Regression](SimilarityRegression.pdf), [Notebook 2 Classification](wxa200000_similarity_algorithms.pdf), [Notebook 3 Clustering](Notebook_3_Clustering.pdf), and [Notebook 4 Dimensionality reduction](PCA_LDA.pdf). 

## Portfolio Component 5: ML with sklearn

This assignment was used to gain experience with ML in sklearn to help show how it works comapared to R. This assignment also goes over how Neural Networks work compared to other algorithms. You can see the ML with sklearn PDF [here](MLWithsklearn.pdf).     

## Portfolio Component 6: Image Classification with DL

This assignment covers the concepts of deep learning by using image classification to read into data and analyze patterns. I worked on this Portfolio Component with Alejo Vinluan(ABV210001). We used tools like tensorflow and sklearn to create models and evaluate results to deduce the accuracry of the various models such as the CNN architecture model. All in all this componenet allowed us to explore past just csv files and look into how machine learning can evaluate imagery. You can see the Document PDF [here](ImageClassification_abv210001_dxa190032.pdf).

## Summary

Throughout my experience of learning the basics of Machine Learning, my entire understanding of how data is read by programs and analyzed was completely changed. I learned how there are many tools that are established to allow data exploration to be very easily such as R and the libraries of Python. Through the many projects that I have undertaken, my skills in data exploration and analysis have improved drastically compared to before I had explored the many aspects of Machine Learning. After finally dipping my feet into the world of ML, it helped show me the vast potential of this technology. We can already see how the massive surge of AI technology has shocked the contemporary world with its vast advancements, but I believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. As more and more data is entered into the digital world, technology will learn more and more, eventually reaching a pivotal point in history. I plan on implementing Machine Learning in future projects since it provides an easy outlet for data exploration, which can prove very useful. And as the world becomes more and more reliant on AI and Machine Learning architecture, I believe that career paths in the ML field will be very fruitful and sought after.
